RSBerry Server
---

RSBerry Server is a java framework designed to work with the Runescape 317 client.

#Goals
With this project, we want to create a framework that allows RSPS admins and programmers to create an efficient, reliable and fun server quickly and easily.

We wont spend much time fleshing out the server with NPCs, items & shops - that's for you to do. We just want to make that process easy.

Eventually (we haven't yet established how feasible it is), we'd like this framework to be cross-version (317, 508, etc).

#Get involved
We don't write flawless code. We want this to be an environment where anyone can get involved. If you find a bug, report it using the issues tab above. If you have an idea or think we've missed something, let us know! If you wanna contribute, feel free to create a pull request! Otherwise, please enjoy the project.
